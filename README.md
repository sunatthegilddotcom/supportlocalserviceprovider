Idea to provide financial relief to local service providers whose businesses are shut down while weâ€™re sheltering in place but whose services we will inevitably use again in the foreseeable future: Temporary subscriptions or pay in advance capabilities. For example, just about every one is going to need a haircut when this is all over with. For those that can afford to do it, pay for your next haircut (or two or three) in advance. Could do the same with dinners at your favorite restaurant, dentist visits, dog groomers, etc. Perhaps folks from companies like Amazon, Shopify, Patreon, Yelp, Apple, Paypal/Venmo, Square/Cash, Stripe, Brex, Intuit, Gofundme, etc., could pitch in to create the functionality and share it and/or open source to enable the largest number of local service providers and their customers to use it. Thoughts?"
